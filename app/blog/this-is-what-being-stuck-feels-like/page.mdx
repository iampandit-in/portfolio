I’m writing this from a place where I don’t really have anything figured out.

No big internships.  
No fancy company names on my resume.  
No money saved.  
No safety net.

Right now, I’m working a non-tech job at **Bajaj Auto**.  
Long hours, physically tiring work, and by the time I get home, most of my energy is already gone.

But my mind is still restless.

## The gap between who I thought I was and where I actually am

For a long time, I imagined myself as someone big in tech.

Someone who builds meaningful products.  
Someone who understands systems deeply.  
Someone who eventually “makes it”.

But reality didn’t match that image at all.

I had:
- No solid projects
- No internships
- No income from tech
- A resume that felt empty
- A constant feeling of being late in life

That gap between **who I thought I could be** and **what I actually was** slowly started hurting.

Instead of facing it directly, I escaped into learning.


## Staying busy without actually moving forward

I convinced myself I was being productive.

React today.  
Next.js tomorrow.  
Backend next.  
Java.  
Python.  
C++.  
App development.  
Game development.

I made long roadmaps.  
Saved bookmarks.  
Watched hours of videos.  
Restarted from scratch again and again.

From the outside, it looked like effort.  
From the inside, it was fear.

As long as I was “preparing”, I didn’t have to face the truth:

I had **nothing real to show**.

## The moment it finally hit me

One day, it became very clear.

I don’t have:
- 6–8 free hours a day
- Financial freedom
- The luxury to explore everything at once

I have around **2 hours a day**, on a good day.

Trying to learn everything in that time wasn’t ambition.  
It was self-sabotage.

I wasn’t failing because I wasn’t smart enough.  
I was failing because I was trying to live multiple lives at the same time.

## Choosing one thing felt like giving up

Deciding to focus on just **one stack** honestly felt depressing at first.

It felt like I was shrinking my dreams.

But I also knew I needed something real.

So I chose:
- React  
- Next.js  
- Node.js  

Not because they’re perfect.  
But because together, they let me build **one complete system**.

Frontend. Backend. Logic. Deployment.

For the first time, the goal wasn’t:
> “Learn more technologies”

The goal was:
> **“Build one real thing, even if it’s ugly.”**

## What I’m actually doing now

I’m building a single full-stack project that I can confidently put on my resume.

No copying tutorials line by line.  
No 20 fake projects.  
No rushing.

Some days I code for 30 minutes.  
Some days I’m exhausted.  
Some days I don’t fully understand what I wrote.

But it’s real work.

Alongside building, I’ve decided to document whatever I can:
- What I learn
- What I mess up
- What confuses me
- How I slowly fix things

Not as an expert.  
But as someone **trying to get unstuck**.

## Why I’m writing this blog

This blog is not here to impress anyone.

It exists because:
- I don’t want to lie on my resume
- I don’t want to fake experience I don’t have
- I want proof that I didn’t give up when things were unclear

If a recruiter reads this, they’ll know exactly where I stand.

If someone else feels less alone after reading this, that’s enough.

## One rule I’m forcing myself to follow

I keep reminding myself of this:

> **I don’t need to become great right now.  
I just need to become consistent.**

Even small progress matters.  
Especially when life feels heavy.

---

## What’s next

I don’t know exactly where this will lead.

But in future posts, I’ll write about:
- How I study and code after a tiring job
- How I’m designing my backend APIs
- How I’m slowly turning this project into a resume-ready application

This is not a success story.

This is the middle of the struggle.

And for the first time, I’m okay admitting that.

## If you’re reading this and you feel behind

You’re not broken.  
You’re probably just overloaded.

Pick one thing.  
Build quietly.  
Let results speak later.

That’s what I’m trying to do.
