I'm writing this from a place where I don't really have anything figured out.

No big internships.  
No fancy company names on my resume.  
No money saved.  
No safety net.

Right now, I'm working a non-tech job at **Bajaj Auto**. Long hours, physically tiring work, and by the time I get home, most of my energy is already gone.

But my mind is still restless.

## The Gap Between Who I Thought I Was and Where I Actually Am

For a long time, I imagined myself as someone who would make it big in tech.

Someone who builds meaningful products.  
Someone who understands systems deeply—from database design to API architecture, from scaling challenges to performance optimization.  
Someone who eventually "makes it."

But reality didn't match that image at all.

I had:
- No solid projects that demonstrated real backend engineering skills
- No internships that would validate my technical abilities
- No income from tech work
- A resume that felt empty despite hours of learning
- A constant feeling of being late in life

That gap between **who I thought I could be** and **what I actually was** slowly started hurting.

Instead of facing it directly, I escaped into learning.

## Staying Busy Without Actually Moving Forward

I convinced myself I was being productive.

**React** today.  
**Next.js** tomorrow.  
**Backend** next.  
**Java**.  
**Python**.  
**C++**.  
**App development**.  
**Game development**.

I made long roadmaps. Saved bookmarks. Watched hours of videos. Restarted from scratch again and again.

From the outside, it looked like effort.  
From the inside, it was fear.

As long as I was "preparing," I didn't have to face the truth:

**I had nothing real to show.**

No deployed applications. No APIs that handled real traffic. No database schemas I designed from scratch. No systems I could explain end-to-end.

## The Moment It Finally Hit Me

One day, it became very clear.

I don't have:
- 6–8 free hours a day to explore everything
- Financial freedom to experiment without pressure
- The luxury to explore everything at once

I have around **2 hours a day**, on a good day.

Trying to learn everything in that time wasn't ambition.  
It was self-sabotage.

I wasn't failing because I wasn't smart enough.  
I was failing because I was trying to live multiple lives at the same time.

## Choosing One Thing Felt Like Giving Up

Deciding to focus on just **one stack** honestly felt depressing at first.

It felt like I was shrinking my dreams. Like I was admitting defeat before even trying.

But I also knew I needed something real—something I could point to and say, "I built this. I understand how it works. I can explain every decision I made."

So I chose:
- **React** for the frontend
- **Next.js** for the framework
- **Node.js** for the backend

Not because they're perfect. Not because they're the "best" technologies.

But because together, they let me build **one complete system**.

Frontend. Backend. Logic. Deployment. Database design. API architecture.

For the first time, the goal wasn't:

> "Learn more technologies"

The goal was:

> **"Build one real thing, even if it's ugly."**

## What I'm Actually Doing Now

I'm building a single full-stack project that I can confidently put on my resume.

No copying tutorials line by line.  
No 20 fake projects that I can't explain.  
No rushing.

Some days I code for 30 minutes.  
Some days I'm exhausted.  
Some days I don't fully understand what I wrote yesterday.

But it's real work.

I'm thinking about:
- How to structure my API endpoints
- How to design my database schema
- How to handle errors gracefully
- How to write code that I'll understand six months from now
- How to deploy something that actually works

Alongside building, I've decided to document whatever I can:
- What I learn about backend architecture
- What I mess up (and how I fix it)
- What confuses me about system design
- How I slowly turn this into something real

Not as an expert.  
But as someone **trying to get unstuck**.

## Why I'm Writing This Blog

This blog is not here to impress anyone.

It exists because:
- I don't want to lie on my resume
- I don't want to fake experience I don't have
- I want proof that I didn't give up when things were unclear
- I want to document the messy process of actually learning

If a recruiter reads this, they'll know exactly where I stand.

If someone else feels less alone after reading this, that's enough.

## One Rule I'm Forcing Myself to Follow

I keep reminding myself of this:

> **I don't need to become great right now.  
> I just need to become consistent.**

Even small progress matters.  
Especially when life feels heavy.

One API endpoint. One database table. One feature that works.

That's progress.

---

## What's Next

I don't know exactly where this will lead.

But in future posts, I'll write about:
- How I study and code after a tiring job
- How I'm designing my backend APIs (the decisions, the trade-offs, the mistakes)
- How I'm thinking about database design and relationships
- How I'm slowly turning this project into a resume-ready application
- The technical challenges I face and how I solve them

This is not a success story.

This is the middle of the struggle.

And for the first time, I'm okay admitting that.

## If You're Reading This and You Feel Behind

You're not broken.  
You're probably just overloaded.

Pick one thing.  
Build quietly.  
Let results speak later.

That's what I'm trying to do.
